## What Is Social Anxiety and What Are Its Symptoms?

A college education is closely related to social interaction. Such a phenomenon as social anxiety can have a serious negative impact on the process of social and emotional adaptation and the quality of life of students. Social anxiety is usually called a state of tension, emotional discomfort, anxiety, and various fears about a particular social situation, as well as other people&#39;s assessment. Being in a situation of interaction and communication with other people, a person with high social anxiety thinks that he looks funny, that others laugh at him and can humiliate him. However, everyone throughout his life constantly finds himself in situations of the need for contact with other people. The study, work, entertainment, and even travel on public transport are closely related to communication. Naturally, it is difficult for a person whose communication situations cause a strong sense of anxiety and discomfort to cope with everyday activities.

## What Are the Consequences of Social Anxiety in College Students?

It often happens that, due to increased anxiety, the student is really unable to act effectively in the presence of other people and, as a rule, without any reason, comes to the conclusion that he is being judged. By avoiding the situation of contact with people, such a student deprives himself of the opportunity to develop his social skills and make sure that he is able to successfully interact with others.

Social phobia is an extreme manifestation of social anxiety. If social anxiety brings discomfort to a person&#39;s life, makes certain situations painful and unpleasant for him, then social phobia leads to serious maladjustment and often to refusal from activities associated with frightening situations. Typical symptoms of social phobia include:

- Acute anxiety;
- Intense tension;
- Facial flushing;
- A lump in the throat;
- Palpitations;
- Dry mouth;
- Nausea;
- Trembling and weakness in the legs;
- Inability to concentrate in situations provoking fear.

The main way out for people suffering from a social phobia is often to avoid any situations that are associated with the likelihood of a negative assessment. They avoid performances, meetings with the opposite sex, parties, which leads to partial or complete social isolation. This severely limits their ability to feel the joys of life and leads to suffering from loneliness.

## Coping with Social Anxiety: Valuable Recommendations

It is important to know that any anxiety can be successfully overcome. There are several proven ways to deal with social anxiety. The most accessible are work and conversation.

The following guidelines can help you deal with social anxiety. The main thing is to put them into practice:

1. Ask yourself &quot;What am I worried about?&quot;. Make a list of what worries you. Then go through each item and determine if there is any cause for concern;
2. If you are worried not for yourself, but for your native people, ask yourself &quot;Does my anxiety help a loved one?&quot;. You will find that there is no reason to worry;
3. If there is no way to change the situation, then there remains the opportunity to change your attitude towards it. Rely on fate and tell yourself: &quot;Whatever happens, happens for the best&quot;;
4. Inflate your anxiety like a balloon to unimaginably large sizes, exaggerate it as soon as you can, try to intimidate yourself well. At a certain moment, you will feel funny, the balloon will burst – and the anxiety will disappear;
5. Try to perceive your anxiety as pleasant excitement, physiologically, these states are in many ways similar;
6. Relieve anxiety with exercise. Running, long walks, oriental practices, and swimming are especially appropriate;
7. If the anxiety is chronic, keep a journal detailing your condition and the ways that have helped you feel better. Reread the diary, making sure that anxiety is like a wave: the tide is always followed by an ebb tide;
8. Discuss the anxiety with loved ones. They will give you moral support and help you understand how justified your fears are;
9. Eat well and in a timely manner. Increase the amount of natural foods containing B vitamins in your diet;
10. Get specialized training. For example, on creating confident behavior.
