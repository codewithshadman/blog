I am a software developer currently living in Mumbai, India. I started this blog as a way to share my knowledge and connect with other fellow coders.

I believe that there is no one way of programming, just as there is no one way of roasting a turkey. But there are terrible ways to do both. This is where I help you out, Ah! I mean in programming and not with roasting a turkey.

Currently, I work on .NET Technologies using C# Language and write my blog post around the same.

Feel free to email me if you want some explanation on a particular topic and I will try to explain it in my future posts. You can have a look at some of my posts <a href="/">here</a>.
