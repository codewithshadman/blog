I am a **software developer** currently living in Mumbai, India. I started this blog as a way to share my knowledge and **connect with other fellow coders.**

I believe that there is no one way of **programming**, just as there is no one way of roasting a turkey. But there are terrible ways to do both. This is where I help you out, Ah! I mean in programming and not with roasting a turkey.

Currently, I work on **.NET Technologies using C# Language** and write my blog post around the same.

Feel free to **[email me](mailto:kudchikarsk@gmail.com)** if you want some explanation on a particular topic and I will try to explain it in my future posts. **You can have a look at some of my posts <a href="/">here</a>.**
