  <h3>ðŸ‘‹ <strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m <strong>Shadman Kudchikar</strong>, a tech lead and backend architect who believes great software begins with asking the right questionsâ€”especially <em>why</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a background in .NET and cloud-native systems, Iâ€™ve spent nearly a decade helping teams scale ideas into production, and code into real-world impact. I'm also the creator of <a href="https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.MicroserviceTemplate" target="_blank"><strong>BytLabs.MicroserviceTemplate</strong></a>, a clean, opinionated template to bootstrap microservices using modern backend practices.

    This blog series is my attempt to distill lessons I wish someone had taught me earlierâ€”not just about code, but about thinking. You can connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadman-kudchikar/" target="_blank"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a>â€”Iâ€™m always up for a chat about software, systems, or ideas that make us better engineers.
